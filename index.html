            So you finally had the guts to come and play The Rock, Paper,
            Scissors, huh? Many men have tried, and many men have failed, but
            The Rock is supposed to be defeated by the likes of you? You think
            you have what it takes to outsmart the Rock? Guess what? IT DOESN'T
            MATTER WHAT YOU PICK – The Rock knows every move, every trick, and
            every play, and The Rock is here to lay the smackdown on any jabroni
            that comes his way! Think you have what it takes to go one-on-one
            with The Great One? Well, if you're gonna mess with the Brahma Bull,
            you better be ready to get the horns. IF YOU SMELL WHAT THE ROCK IS
            COOKING. Click <a href="#game-section">HERE</a> or scroll down to
            begin playing.
