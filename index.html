            So you finally had the guts to come and play The Rock, Paper,
            Scissors, huh? Many men have tried, and many men have failed, but
            The Rock is supposed to be defeated by the likes of you? You think
            you have what it takes to outsmart the Rock? Guess what? IT DOESN'T
            MATTER WHAT YOU PICK – The Rock knows every move, every trick, and
            every play, and The Rock is here to lay the smackdown on any jabroni
            that comes his way! Think you have what it takes to go one-on-one
            with The Great One? Well, if you're gonna mess with the Brahma Bull,
            you better be ready to get the horns. IF YOU SMELL WHAT THE ROCK IS
            COOKING. Click <a href="#game-section">HERE</a> or scroll down to
            begin playing.

<!-- Ideas:
- Start with emojis
- Make the rock the rock button. call it "The Rock, Paper, Scissors lol" 
- background is pics of the rock alternating every few minutes.
- eventually make a link and stuff like that so it's a game on my site
- make it responsive duh
- implement a text input so you can type rock, paper, or scissors and it will capitalize the first letter and then match it if it's R, P, or S.
- make a bank where you can bet money. depends how much you have in the bank. then maybe you have to beg the rock for money to get more.
- instead of "computer" have it say Rocky. there should be 8bit gifs above the text too of you being a skinny gym wimp and the rock in his wrestling attire
- certain words in the opening message should have a span element so we can style to words a little bit
